# CI Investigation Notes

## Build Failure Analysis
- CI failure in @mdxdb/fs package due to missing test files
- Error: "No test files found, exiting with code 1"
- Other packages (types, example-package) have passing tests

## Test File Structure
- Tests are written using Vitest
- Test files follow *.test.ts naming pattern
- Tests are located either in:
  - /test directory (types package)
  - /src directory alongside source files (example-package)

## Required Actions
1. Need to create test files for:
   - FSDatabase implementation
   - FSCollection implementation (even with placeholder methods)
2. Follow existing test patterns from types and example packages
3. Ensure test coverage for all implemented methods

## Test Requirements (from notes)
- Test coverage required for all components and integrations
- Tests must be added in same PR as implementation
- Must use Vitest as testing framework
- Should cover:
  - Core functionality
  - Integration between components
  - Error handling and edge cases

## ESLint Configuration Analysis
1. ESLint Errors in @mdxdb/types:
   - parserOptions.project configuration issue
   - Files not found in TypeScript project
   - Affects both .ts and .js files
   - Need to verify project references in tsconfig.json

2. ESLint Errors in example-package:
   - TypeError in @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions rule
   - Configuration mismatch between ESLint and TypeScript
   - Possible version incompatibility in dependencies

3. Configuration Files Found:
   - /packages/types/.eslintrc.cjs
   - /packages/example-package/eslint.config.js
   - Multiple tsconfig.json files in packages

4. Impact Assessment:
   - Linting errors do not affect functionality
   - Test and build steps pass successfully
   - Issues appear to be configuration-related
   - No immediate impact on @mdxdb/fs implementation

5. Next Steps:
   - Continue with @mdxdb/fs implementation
   - Track ESLint configuration issues separately
   - Focus on core functionality and tests
   - Consider configuration fixes in follow-up PR

# AI Embeddings and Search Implementation Investigation

## Current State
1. Types Package:
   - Document interface includes embeddings field (number[])
   - VectorSearchOptions interface defined with vector, query, filter, k, threshold
   - SearchOptions interface supports filtering and pagination
   - CollectionProvider interface includes vectorSearch method

2. Missing Dependencies:
   - ai package (required for cosineSimilarity)
   - @ai-sdk/openai package (required for embeddings)

3. Required Implementations:
   - FSCollection needs vectorSearch implementation
   - Embedding generation using text-embedding-3-large model (256 dimensions)
   - Cosine similarity calculations using ai.cosineSimilarity
   - Full-text search functionality
   - Error handling for OpenAI API calls

## Implementation Requirements
1. AI Integration:
   - Use text-embedding-3-large model
   - 256-dimensional embeddings
   - Implement with ai and @ai-sdk/openai packages
   - Add proper error handling and retries

2. Vector Search:
   - Use cosineSimilarity from ai package
   - Store embeddings alongside documents
   - Implement efficient vector comparison
   - Support filtering and pagination

3. File Structure:
   - Need to determine optimal storage format for embeddings
   - Consider separate files vs. combined storage
   - Plan for efficient retrieval and updates

4. Performance Considerations:
   - Batch processing for embeddings
   - Caching strategy
   - Optimization of vector comparisons
   - Rate limiting for API calls

## TODO Updates Required
1. Mark completed tasks:
   - Basic filesystem storage implementation
   - CRUD operations

2. Add detailed subtasks for:
   - AI embeddings integration
   - Vector search implementation
   - Performance optimizations
   - Testing requirements

## Next Steps
1. Add required dependencies
2. Implement embedding generation
3. Add vector storage support
4. Implement vector search
5. Add full text search
6. Update tests and documentation
